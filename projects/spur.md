This was our project for HackOHI/O 2016. The team consisted of [Cameron Sinko](https://github.com/csinko), [Stephen Kocsis](https://github.com/TheRCguy), and myself.

Spur makes it really easy to boot multiple OSes on your computer. In a nutshell, it is a USB device with a toggle switch. Depending on the position of the switch, it will force your computer to boot one OS or another. No longer do you need to spam the F12 key and wait for the boot menu to load to switch between operating systems. After configuring spur, simply plug it in, flick the switch, and boot.
