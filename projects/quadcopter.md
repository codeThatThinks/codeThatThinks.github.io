## Version 2

This is an in-progress build of a 350-size H quad. It's designed to be more durable and reliable. I'm reusing a few components from the first version so that I can recover a little bit of money from it.

### Specs

**Note: Untested, but eCalc says it should fly quite well.**

* Frame: Custom 350-size; Made from 1mm and 1.5mm 3K carbon fiber
* Motors: Turnigy Aerodrive D2830-11 1000kv
* ESCs: Turnigy Multistar 30A w/ SBEC
* Props: Genuine APC Multirotor 9x4.5
* Battery: Zippy Flightmax 3000mAh 4S 20C LiPo
* Flight Controller: Naze32 Full running Cleanflight
* Receiver: OrangeRX R615x 6ch 2.4GHz
* Telemetry: cheap clone of 3DR Telemetry Module 915mHz
* FPV Camera: FatShark 700TVL CMOS
* FPV Transmitter: FatShark 5.8GHz 250mW w/ ImmersionRC LHCP SpiroNet antenna

## Version 1

The first version of my quadcopter was a 400-size X quad. It was constructed under a very tight budget, and while it flew, it was not durable and did not perform well. It suffered a hard crash and the frame completely disintegrated.

### Specs

**Note: Please do not build a quadcopter using this spec list. It doesn't fly well.**

* Frame: Custom 400-size; Made from plastic and fiberglass
* Motors: Turnigy Aerodrive D2830-11 1000kv
* ESCs: Turnigy Multistar 30A w/ SBEC
* Props: cheap clone of APC Electric 8x4
* Battery: Zippy Compact 4000mAh 3S 25C LiPo
* Flight Controller: Custom running Multiwii; Arduino Pro Mini; GY-80 IMU
* Receiver: Turnigy 9X8C v2 8ch 2.4GHz
* Telemetry: cheap clone of 3DR Telemetry Module 915mHz
