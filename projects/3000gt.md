This is where I document various mods, upgrades, and fixes I've done to my daily driver/project car, a 1993 Mitsubishi 3000gt VR-4.

The car is mostly stock except for the following mods:
- K&N intake
- aftermarket y-pipe
- manual boost controller
- vacuum line reduction & EGR delete
- Tein S lowering springs
