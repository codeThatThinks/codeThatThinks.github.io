A 3D printer farm has become a necessity as the amount of printing I do has increased drastically. With multiple printers I can have multiple prints running in parallel, plus added redundancy if a printer is down, and the ability to set up individual printers for specific types of prints.

My brother picked up a large 8020 cabinet from industrial surplus which happens to be a good size for four Ender 3 printers. Since we're setting up the farm in a shared commercial building due to lack of space, the enclosure should help with any ambient temperature fluctuations.
