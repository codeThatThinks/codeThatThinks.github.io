SecureDrawer is a device that can be attached to any drawer and uses Bluetooth Low Energy to automatically and painlessly lock and unlock it depending on your phone's proximity to the drawer.

During RevolutionUC 2018, we built a prototype using an Arduino Pro Mini to actuate a servo which moves the locking mechanism. A 9DOF IMU module detects vibration and can be used to determine if the drawer is being tampered with. A piezo buzzer and RGB led provide cues for when the drawer locks, unlocks, or is left open.
