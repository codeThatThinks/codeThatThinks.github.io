### GY-291

![GY-291](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-291-thumbnail.jpg)   
Actual size ([View Larger Image](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-291.jpg))

[Schematic for GY-291](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-291-schematic.jpg)

A 3DOF IMU with a [ADXL345](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf) three-axis accelerometer. The GY-291 isn't technically an IMU because it lacks a gyroscope. It's basically a breakout board for the ADXL345.

There are two M3 mounting holes and holes for an 8 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit in the mounting holes.

This module is capable of running off 3.3-5V, as it includes an onboard voltage regulator. **However, since this module does not include a level shifter, maximum logic voltage is 3.6V. 5V logic will fry the ADXL345.** Communication is done through I<sup>2</sup>C.

It is available on eBay for about $2-3. Search "GY-291".


### GY-521

Actual size ([View Larger Image](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-521.jpg))

[Schematic for GY-521](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-521-schematic.jpg)

A 6DOF IMU with a [MPU-6050](http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General%20IC/PS-MPU-6000A.pdf) three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope that includes a digital motion processor (DMP).

There are two M3 mounting holes and holes for an 8 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit in the mounting holes.

This module will run off 3.3-5V, as it includes an onboard voltage regulator. **However, since this module does not include a level shifter, maximum logic voltage is 3.46V. 5V logic will fry the MPU-6050.** Communication is done through I<sup>2</sup>C.

It is available on eBay for about $2-4. Search "6DOF IMU" or "GY-521".


### GY-80

![GY-80](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-80-thumbnail.jpg)   
Actual size ([View Larger Image](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-80.jpg))

[Schematic for GY-80](/content/misc/cheap-ebay-electronics/GY-80-schematic.jpg)

A 10DOF IMU module that includes [L3G4200D](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00265057.pdf) (three-axis gyroscope), [ADXL345](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf) (three-axis accelerometer), [HMC5883L](http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf) (three-axis magnetometer), and [BMP085](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BMP085_Flyer_Rev.0.2_March2008.pdf) (barometer + temperature) sensors.

There are two M3 mounting holes and holes for a 10 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit in the mounting holes. Two variations are available. The board layout is generally the same but the silkscreen color may be red or blue. Modules with red silkscreen include extra capacitors near the mounting holes, making it impossible to use mounting screws where the head of the screw is larger than 4mm. Fillister head machine screws can be used, as they have smaller heads, or normal machine screws can be sanded down to fit.

The module is capable of running off of 3.3-5V, as it includes an onboard voltage regulator. Also includes an onboard level shifter so it can be used with 5V logic. Communication is done though I<sup>2</sup>C.

It is available on eBay for about $10-20. Search "10DOF IMU" or "GY-80".


### GY-81

A 10DOF IMU module that is identical to the GY-80 except that it includes an [ITG3205](http://www.tinyosshop.com/datasheet/itg3205.pdf) (three-axis gyroscope) instead of the L3G4200D, and a [BMA180](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Accelerometer/BST-BMA180-DS000-03.pdf) (three-axis accelerometer) instead of the ADXL345. The GY-81 has the same [HMC5883L](http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf) (three-axis magnetometer) and [BMP085](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BMP085_Flyer_Rev.0.2_March2008.pdf) (barometer + temperature) sensors.

There are two M3 mounting holes and holes for a 10 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit in the mounting holes.

The module is capable of running off of 3.3-5V, as it includes an onboard voltage regulator. Also includes an onboard level shifter so it can be used with 5V logic. Communication is done though I<sup>2</sup>C.

It is available on eBay for about $10-20. Search "10DOF IMU" or "GY-81".


### GY-85

A 9DOF IMU module that includes [ITG3205](http://www.tinyosshop.com/datasheet/itg3205.pdf) (three-axis gyroscope), [ADXL345](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf) (three-axis accelerometer), and [HMC5883L](http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf) (three-axis magnetometer) sensors.

There is one M3 mounting hole and holes for an 8 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit in the mounting holes.
