A 10DOF IMU modules that includes [L3G4200D](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00265057.pdf) (three-axis gyroscope), [ADXL345](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf) (three-axis accelerometer), [HMC5883L](http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf) (three-axis magnetometer), and [BMP085](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BMP085_Flyer_Rev.0.2_March2008.pdf) (barometer + temperature) sensors.

There are two M3 mounting holes and holes for a 10 pin .1" header. #4 machine screws will also fit. Two variations are available. The board layout is generally the same but the silkscreen color may be red or blue. Modules with red silkscreen include extra capacitors near the mounting holes, making it impossible to use mounting screws where the head of the screw is larger than 4mm. Fillister head machine screws can be used, as they have smaller heads, or normal machine screws can be sanded down to fit.

The module is capable of running off of 3.3-5V, as it includes an onboard voltage regulator. Also includes an onboard level shifter so it can be used with 5V logic. Communication is done though I<sup>2</sup>C.

It is available on eBay for about ~$10-20. Search "10 DOF IMU" or "GY-80".
