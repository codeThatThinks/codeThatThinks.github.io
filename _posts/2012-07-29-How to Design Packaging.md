Packaging is one of the most important aspects of a product. People forget that. Often.

The packaging is the first thing that the user come in contact with. It's the front-end of the both the product and the company selling it. If it's crappy, chances are the product will also be crappy, or so the user will think.

There are many things that go into designing great packaging.

A product's packaging is meant to appeal to the user. It should make the user want to buy the product. This is easily accomplished by most companies.

Packaging also need to be functional. If it can't hold the product in an efficient manner, you failed.

Following the basic principles of design, packaging also needs to be unobtrusive. The user should be able to easily open the package and begin using the product as soon as possible. That means I shouldn't have to go find a tool (i.e scissors, box knife) and muscle open your horribly designed packaging.

Clamshell and shrink wrap packaging are a great examples of obtrusive packaging. Don't design that.

Eco-friendliness and the lifecycle of the packaging should also be considered in the design. While it isn't a requirement for excellent packaging, do you really need to use that much styrofoam? Try to pick biodegradable or easily recyclable materials over less eco-friendly alternatives. I enjoy paper-based packaging because I can easily toss it into my recycle bin once I'm done with it.

In terms of the lifecycle of the product, think about all the steps the user will go through with the packaging. Is it reusable? Can it act as a stand for the product? Or is it simply a disposable cheap piece of plastic that will soon end up in a landfill?

Design great packaging. It's is just as important as product design. Never forget that.
