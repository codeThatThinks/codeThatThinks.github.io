Happy New Year! It's now 2012!

This is my first post on my new blog. I find that a blog is the best way to communicate to the peoples of the internet the more lengthy details of my daily life. Yes, Twitter is great, but it's only limited to 130 characters per tweet.

As a New Year's resolution, and as I am now doing with Twitter, I will try to blog every week. Yes every week. Hopefully this will work.
