Ok, let's be real here. The world (almost certainly) will not end on December 21st, 2012. Yeah, the Mayan Calendar might end, but all other calendars end too. The world doesn't end when our calendars do, and neither should the Mayan calendar be any different.

One thing we can be certain of, though, is that people have fear. While the world most certainly won't end, there's always that incomprehensible small chance that it will. I mean, it's only logical.

It's people's fear of the end of the world that will cause issues. One might stockpile goods, further increasing imbalance in society and the chance of violent outbursts by opposing peoples. People pay attention to the acts of others, and, in some cases, acts in the name of fear may create a chain-reaction throughout society.

The world will not end on its own, instead, society's fear will, on it's own, cause the end of the world.
