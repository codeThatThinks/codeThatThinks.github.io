It does.

I code in a text editor. Sublime Text 2 Beta to be exact. I also compile by hand. Email is done in Sparrow; my todo list is still in iCal, because I use the default iOS Reminders app. I've tried countless softwares when it comes to project management. I no longer mange my projects. I've got Dropbox for all my client work, and I use Google Drive for backups. I also backup to a Time Capsule. In recent years I've switched from GIMP to Photoshop CS5 and from Inkscape to Illustrator CS5.

On the hardware side of things, I've got a dual monitor setup, but the two screens have two different ppis, so stuff looks weird sometimes. My main machine is a Hackintosh, sporting a Sandy Bridge Core i5, 8 GB of RAM, and a factory overclocked MSI Raedon 5770.

As you may or may not know, I use the craptop (basically my netbook) for development while I'm not at home. Yes, I use it at Starbucks. And that's about it. Any ideas on how I can improve this setup?
