When I first revived this blog around the start of 2012, I promised myself that I would keep it updated and prevent it from falling by the wayside, like the site before it, and, uh, the one before that.

When I switched this blog over to Anchor CMS recently, I had the opportunity to look back at all the things I wrote about. I especially noticed the frequency of my posts.

The past months have been a disappointment to this blog. After this blog was hit with an insane amount of traffic in late July, and, ironically, went offline, I stopped posting. The project of finding a new web host paired with the realization that summer break was almost over really led to this blog's demise. The habit of writing daily was broken.

Months later, I resumed freelance work. Getting my site back online suddenly became a priority. Within a few days of sketching and a few nights of coding, I launched the next version of my site. This blog, however, was still broken.

Recently, a client asked for a complete redesign of their site. I thought, why not use Anchor CMS? In short, I used the rehabilitation and migration of this blog over to Anchor CMS to gain experience using this new and excellent piece of software so I could then satisfy my client's needs.

In the end, this blog is back online and here to stay. I have a new goal this time: to post even more frequently than before. Expect some awesome content in the coming days, and, please, keep reading.
