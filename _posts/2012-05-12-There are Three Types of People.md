I’ve heard many programmers say that there are 10 types of people, but, after 15 years of living on this planet, I believe there are more.

Most of the time, you will encounter only two types of people.

First, there are the analytical people. They perceive the world in the form of numbers and statistics. While this makes them lack a bit more in things that require creativity, they find themselves more suited to be able to think though and solve problems and answer questions using logical reasoning. I used to consider myself an analytical person.

And then there are the creative people. People who enjoy being unique and don’t care about blending in with the crowd. Hipsters too. They find themselves easily able to transform ideas in pictures and words, each with vibrant color.

As I said, very rarely will you encounter anyone but the two types of people above. It takes a special kind of person to fall into the third type.

So what’s the third type?

The makers. It may seem like sort of a weird kind of type, and many people might mistake it for one of the two types above, but, in my opinion, I believe these kind of people deserve their own type.

They’re not analytical people, nor are they not creative people—they’re both. Have someone be able to understand a problem in an analytical sense and then develop a creative, and therefore innovative, solution to the problem: chances are that they fall into this special category of people.

Take note of these people, because they are truly the brilliant people of the world. Also, which kind of person are you?
