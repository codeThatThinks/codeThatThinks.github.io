*Update: After talking to fellow programmers about this post, I realized that this post could've been made more clear. Many programmers use 'code' to describe the syntax of a programming language, while 'programming' is the act of thinking, planning, and analyzing a problem while writing code in order to write efficient and well written software. When I said 'learning to code', I actually meant 'learning to program'. Sorry for any confusion.*

Anyone can learn the syntax of a specific programming language. Only a few will actually learn to code.

It doesn't seem that way, however. Many people in my CS class think they can learn to code, merely because they are taking that class. And after all, isn’t that the purpose of the class?

The simple answer is no. That CS class you're taking doesn't have the time or resources necessary to teach you to code. I hate to break it to you, but you know that *Learn C++ in 10 Days* book you just bought? That isn't going to teach you how to code either.

It's unfortunate that people miss the fact that learning syntax and learn to code are two different things.

The process which I took to learn how to code was not pretty. I didn't read any books. I didn't bug anyone to teach me. I learned through trial and error, and somehow I stayed interested throughout the entire process.

I began with QBasic, and later moved onto Visual Basic. Eventually I heard about C++ and was determined to learn it. It was then that I realized that I never learned how to code.

I was able to write in that particular language. I was able to write something that would run flawlessly. I was not, however, able to solve a problem or accomplish any sort of task with my code. All because I never actually learned to code. I just learned the syntax.

It's funny how learning to code actually has more to do with problem solving in general than actual programming.

In order to be a brilliant and successful programmer, you need to think. You need to become an algorithmist. You need to be able figure out the problem at hand, think through it, and develop a solution—all while battling the syntax of a particular language. Quite frankly, learning the syntax doesn't help you with any of that.

And that's why I come to say that not everyone is able to learn how to code.
