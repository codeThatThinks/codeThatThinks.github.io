*Update: Most, if not all, the problems outlined in this post have been fixed. In the process I've [open sourced this Anchor CMS theme](http://github.com/codeThatThinks/ianglen.me-Anchor-CMS-Theme). Feel free to modify it for your own needs.*

Some of you guys (especially [Will Smidlein](http://twitter.com/ws)) have complained about the readability of this blog.

I think it looks pretty damn good on my Desktop, and the main font, with an opacity of 60% white, contrasts nicely with the background, an image of 40% opacity on black.

Now, I'm not quite sure whether it's the title, date, and footer texts people are complaining about. At 20% white on a black background, I do agree that, on certain devices and poorly calibrated monitors, it might be a bit hard to see.

When I tested this new design on my iPad, which was done surprisingly after I had already released the new design, I could start to see the issues people are experiencing. The title and date texts were still readable, but the footer was almost nonexistent. The screen on my 1st generation iPad seems to have more contrast, although still maintains excellent vibrance of colors.

If you've noticed, I've corrected these issues to some extent. I made the background at bit darker by decreasing the image opacity to 30%. I've also increased the opacity of any text that was at 20% to 30%.

Please realize that this blog is still a work in progress. I've yet to add an RSS feed so you guys can read my posts in Google Reader and Flipboard. I also need to fix a few bugs in the responsive layout on mobile devices. Finally, I should migrate over all my old blog posts and fix some of the typos and formatting issues in a few posts.
