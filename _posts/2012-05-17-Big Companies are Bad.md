I hate big companies. I really do. Not because of all the corporate mumbo jumbo that goes on, but because of the loss of focus on the product (or service) at hand.

Last time I checked, the point the company in the first place was to 1) produce a product that people will both want and enjoy and 2) be able to make money of selling that specific product or service. When companies grow, I feel that some of the focus on these two points is lost. Let's use a company that makes Mac apps as an example.

From a literal point of view, it takes an extremely small group of people to build and distribute a Mac app. You'll need people to code and possibly a graphic designer. Since the app will be distributed via the Mac App Store, almost no one is required to handle marketing.

In this current stage of the example, the company is roughly three or four guys. And, according to my opinion, that's the way it should stay.

When companies grow, one major problem arises. Suddenly, people are required to manage the other people, because, unlike a small company, not all the developers and designers are able to meet up at a coffee shop and touch base. With this, lesser and lesser focus is being put on the product.

The product matters. It's the thing that brings in money for the company. Without it, nothing would be possible. A while ago I tweeted a notable quote that I believe fits well with this issue.

> Build things to be awesome, not because you want to make a buck.

I've seen many large companies trying to sport a product where the quality has declined to such a degree that the most accurate description of it is complete and utter crap. I hate that.

While small company size isn't a sure-fire way to ensure quality, it helps a great deal. Nor am I saying that all large companies produce crappy products; I know quite I few with amazing quality.
