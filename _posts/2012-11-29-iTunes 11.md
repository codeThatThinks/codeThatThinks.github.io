Today Apple released iTunes 11. Many people were eager to get there hands on it mainly because it features a complete reworking of everything. Since, arguably, iTunes is the lowest quality piece of software that Apple is responsible for, this is a big deal.

When iTunes 11 finally downloaded and installed for me, the first big thing I noticed was its speed. My past experiences with iTunes always had this slight delay before it did anything. This lagginess, paired with the amount of time it took iTunes to launch, made it feel very cumbersome and bulky. Fortunately, this new version of iTunes not only launches quickly, but it does whatever I want instantaneously. From what I can tell, there has also been an increase in speed when requesting things from the iTunes Store.

It took me a while to notice the updated icon, but after numerous tweets about it in my timeline, I realized that there was such a change. The music note has been changed to white. Why, I do not know. I'm not particularly fond of it, as it seems to conflict with the inner drop shadow around the entire icon and the small drop shadow around the music note itself.

Overall, the entire interface of iTunes has been simplified. The sidebar is now hidden by default, and everything has been given a refreshed and updated look. Also, is that Helvetica I spy?

iTunes 11 was supposed to be Apple's plan to get people to stop complaining about it. Unfortunately, many people have only complained more. It seems that people were expecting the many issues with iTunes to get fixed in this one update. But, it needs to be realized that iTunes 11 is a stepping stone, a second chance. iTunes 11 feels like a giant improvement. Not on the visual side of things, but in the inner workings of the software. iTunes 11 is the start of a path to a better iTunes, and people need to realize that there's still a long way to go.

Anyway, I'm happy to say that I'm still fairly impressed with this new iTunes.
