					<p><i>This post was written a really long time ago and was one of the first posts on the first iteration of my blog. Excuse the grammer and spelling.</i></p>
					<p>Have you ever heard of HTML5? Chances are that you haven't. Well, it's the next version of HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, the web programming language that is used to create all websites. The last version, HTML 4.1, came out way back when in 1998, and a lot has changed since then. If you browse the internet a lot, you probably know about Flash Player, which is a browser plug-in for viewing dynamic and "flashy" content on websites. Flash Player is fairly new, with the Adobe version coming out only a few years ago, and with the current version being Flash Player 10. Flash and HTML5 basically serve the same purpose, but each have their pros and cons.</p>
					<p>HTML5 is a great way to get dynamic content on a website. It is a web standard and is controlled by W3C, the organization responsible for internet standards, so it is very open-ended. It is supported by a variety of browsers, such as Firefox 4 Beta, Internet Explorer 9 Beta, Safari 5, and Mobile Safari. HTML5 is efficient and lean, so it is able to run fast on iDevices and other mobile devices. HTML5 is a version of HTML, so it doesn't require a plug-in and is supported natively by browsers. Unfortunately, it is fairly new and isn't supported by most non-beta browsers and is still under development. HTML5 introduces a couple new elements, such as canvas, audio, video, and article. With HTML5, amazing web applications can now be created like <a href="http://www.scale18.com/canvas6.html">this in-browser GUI</a> or <a href"http://bit.ly/8fqFYN">this drawing website</a> (broken link). Since HTML5 works on iDevices, Google Docs, YouTube, and other popular websites have begun developing HTML5 versions of their dynamic content. Google Docs has an HTML5 version of their web application, although iDevices don't currently support HTML5 WYSIWYG editors, so you are unable to edit your documents. YouTube is working on an HTML5 version of their video player, and Yahoo! Mail has upgraded to an awesome HTML5 interface. For me, HTML5 means new capability for my blog/website. While I won't use HTML5 to create a new interface for content, HTML5 will allow me to be able to add new interactive features into content and dynamic articles that change based upon a user's unique computer settings. In my opinion, HTML5 will become a really valuable tool in web design.</p>
					<p>Flash on the other hand, is Adobe's way of getting dynamic content on websites. Now remember, Flash was developed before HTML5, back when Internet Explorer 7 was around. W3C wasn't even thinking about creating another version of HTML, so having flash be a browser plug-in was a logical decision. Now in days, browser plug-ins are near-obsolete, so the thought of Adobe continuing the development of Flash is questionable. To develop flash "movies", developers need to buy the very-overpriced Adobe Flash CS5 Suite, while HTML5 just requires a text editor. Also, HTML5 is easier to learn, because of it's similarity to XML, while Flash development requires the knowledge of ActionScript, which is harder because it's based upon Java. Flash also has a tendency to crash your browser, while HTML5 is lightweight and stable. Flash isn't very lean, so it runs slower on older computers. It may seem that HTML5 completely blows away Flash, but there are some things that HTML5 can not do (yet). Only Flash can generate 3D models in-real time, and use blending modes on images, such as multiply, darken, overlay, lighten, etc. Just recently, webcam and microphone support was added to HTML5, so it's not a Flash-only feature anymore. Flash can manipulate bitmap data, while HTML5 only comes as close as the canvas element, which really isn't very similar. Flash also has access to GPU's, if your computer has one. HTML5 has hardware acceleration, which is close, but it is only available in Firefox 4 Beta.</p>
					<p>So, which is best? Does HTML5 completely blow away Flash, or should we forget about HTML5? In my opinion, everyone should mainly use HTML5, because it is going to be a web standard, while Flash will become more outdated and unstable. HTML5 will become a great way to deploy dynamic content on websites, and is more compatible with a larger variety of devices. If you are going to want to use simple dynamic content on your website, choose HTML5. For harder tasks, like real-time 3D rendering, choose Flash, but be aware that it will crash sometime eventually and isn't supported on browsers that don't have the flash plug-in installed. Hopefully W3C will further extend the capabilities of HTML5, because it's going to be awesome!</p>
