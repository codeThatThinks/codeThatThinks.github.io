					<blockquote><p>The problem with the internet is that nothing is temporary. There’s always a cache, a backup, a screenshot, a file. And teens use the internet. And when people use the internet, they don’t always think before they act. This is true for blog comments, hurtful Facebook posts, threatening emails, etc.</p></blockquote></p>
					<p>This is extremely, extremely accurate.</p></p>
					<p>This is why I didn't join Twitter until mid-2011. The permanence of the Internet always scared me. It was the reason I never joined Twitter or Facebook earlier. While I knew these services existed, I afraid to use them, as it might have a negative affect on me in the future. In recent times, I've become less and less paranoid, and eventually, after meeting Will Smidlein, I joined Twitter, and, in the case of Facebook, after much persuading, I joined Facebook.</p></p>
					<p>I feel like writing a few paragraphs on how common sense prevents any issue related to this from ever happening, but I won't. Common sense is not common.</p></p>
					<blockquote><p>Please, think before you post, especially if you’re a teenager. You don’t want one dumb mistake to ruin the rest of your life, or worse yet, someone else’s life.</p></blockquote>
