					<p>That was the response I received when I asked my math teacher about a problem today. That basically meant that he hadn't any idea of how to go about solving the problem and to "just think about it" and have the answer come to you magically.</p>
					<p>This was not the response I was expecting. My classmates must not of thought so either, because after a couple of minutes of 'thinking', they too were still stumped by the problem.</p>
					<p>This brings up another thought I had at the moment, regarding the general thought of what should be taught in schools. While I'm not trying to insult any teachers or debunk their methods here, I believe that our education system, particularly that of the American education system, is horribly broken.</p>
					<p>This may seem a little extreme, but kids these days aren't being taught what they need to know to be successful in life. Instead, they're being taught raw knowledge, totally worthless unless someone is taught how to use it. One-sided methods for doing things are also being taught, but kids lack the ability to further develop and adapt those methods. This needs to change.</p>
					<p>Change to what, you may ask? We need to empower kids to think on their own, ask questions, and effectively solve problems, such as the one noted above. Teach them to solve problems, and they will go and get the knowledge themselves. Without this, our future is crippled.</p>
					<p>So, coming back to my main point, how do you actually go about solving problems where you're told to "just think about it"?</p>
					<p><b>Do what you know</b>. Assess the problem and look at information you already know, even if it seems obvious. This is what you'll use to continue through the problem to get to the solution.</p>
					<p><b>Don't jump to the solution</b>. If you try to guess the solution without taking the necessary steps, you will fail. Unfortunately, I find this extremely hard to overcome.</p>
					<p><b>Don't assume you know the answer</b>. Chances are that you won't find it easily. This goes hand in hand with jumping to the solution.</p>
					<p><b>Think logically</b>. It may seem like a restatement of 'just think about it' but it actually is far from it. When moving from problem to solution, make sure you can explain all the steps you have taken. Don't do anything irrational, otherwise you will fail.</p>
					<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>$1000 is given away over the course of five (5) days. The amount given away increases by $50 each day. Find the amount given away for each day.</code></pre>
					<p>Seems like quite a brain-teaser, doesn't it? Using the steps above, the solution can be found more easily than if someone was told to "just think about it".</p>
					<p>This is what we know:</p>
<pre><code>day 1 + day 2 + day 3 + day 4 + day 5 = $1000
day 1 is at least $50
day 2 is at least $50 + $50
day 3 is at least $50 + $50 + $50
day 4 is at least $50 + $50 + $50 + $50
day 5 is at least $50 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50</code></pre>
					<p>Ok, now let's see how much money we have left.</p>
<pre><code>$50 x 15 = $750
$1000 - $750 = $250</code></pre>
					<p>Now what? We need to divide up the rest of the money.</p>
<pre><code>$250 / 5 = $50</code></pre>
					<p>Hey look! $250 can be divided up evenly. Now let's finalize and get our answer.</p>
<pre><code>day 1: $100 = $50 + $50
day 2: $150 = $50 + $50 + $50
day 3: $200 = $50 + $50 + $50 + $50
day 4: $250 = $50 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50
day 5: $300 = $50 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50 + $50</code></pre>
					<p>I think we have it now. Let's check our work.</p>
<pre><code>$100 + $150 + $200 + $250 + $300 = $1000</code></pre>
					<p>That problem, courtesy of the math department, was able to be successfully thought through and solved. You mileage may vary.</p>
