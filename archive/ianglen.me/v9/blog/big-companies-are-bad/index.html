					<p>I hate big companies. I really do. Not because of all the corporate mumbo jumbo that goes on, but because of the loss of focus on the product (or service) at hand.</p>
					<p>Last time I checked, the point the company in the first place was to 1) produce a product that people will both want and enjoy and 2) be able to make money of selling that specific product or service. When companies grow, I feel that some of the focus on these two points is lost. Let's use a company that makes Mac apps as an example.</p>
					<p>From a literal point of view, it takes an extremely small group of people to build and distribute a Mac app. You'll need people to code and possibly a graphic designer. Since the app will be distributed via the Mac App Store, almost no one is required to handle marketing.</p>
					<p>In this current stage of the example, the company is roughly three or four guys. And, according to my opinion, that's the way it should stay.</p>
					<p>When companies grow, one major problem arises. Suddenly, people are required to manage the other people, because, unlike a small company, not all the developers and designers are able to meet up at a coffee shop and touch base. With this, lesser and lesser focus is being put on the product.</p>
					<p>The product matters. It's the thing that brings in money for the company. Without it, nothing would be possible. A while ago I tweeted a notable quote that I believe fits well with this issue.</p>
					<blockquote>Build things to be awesome, not because you want to make a buck.</blockquote>
					<p>I've seen many large companies trying to sport a product where the quality has declined to such a degree that the most accurate description of it is complete and utter crap. I hate that.</p>
					<p>While small company size isn't a sure-fire way to ensure quality, it helps a great deal. Nor am I saying that all large companies produce crappy products; I know quite I few with amazing quality.</p>
