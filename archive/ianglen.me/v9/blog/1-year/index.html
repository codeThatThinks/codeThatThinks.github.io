					<p>I can barely believe it's been a year since I revived this blog. This time one year ago, I was rushing to put the finishing touches on the relaunch, not even sure that it would survive a month or two.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, it did survive. There were many lessons learned along the way, and hopefully it provided some value to people. Reviving this blog from my 7th grade attempt at contributing to the Internet was definitely worthwhile.</p>
					<p>Now, I'm willing to try something new. Should I switch to a different medium, such as video or podcasting? Or, should I keep with blogging but switch to something more innovative, such as Medium? How do you think I should improve this blog?</p>
