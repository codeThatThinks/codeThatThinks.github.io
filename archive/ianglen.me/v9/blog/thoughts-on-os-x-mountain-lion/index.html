					<p>When I first heard about Mountain Lion, I was in disbelief. How could such a company prepare to release another major update to it's operating system when the last major version has had only two minor updates?</p>
					<p>Soon, though, I began to realize what Apple was thinking. I call it the Vista model. Simply put, Windows Vista was the worst major version of Windows. There were more bugs than added features. Security holes ate away at the meat of the OS. Windows XP lasted for many years before Microsoft released Vista. Vista only lasted two.</p>
					<p>Apple is thinking the same way, with Lion, in my opinion, being the worst release of OSX to date. Yes, the bugs in Lion were much fewer than what was found in Vista, but these bugs were serious enough to disrupt the peace of mind that all Mac users enjoy. Snow Leopard was around for a few notable years, and Lion has only been around for months, not even years.</p>
					<p>So okay, I'm fine if Apple feels another major update is necessary to restore the awesomeness of OSX. I'd love it if the bugs I experience everyday just went away. So if Mountain Lion is a fix for those bugs, so be it.</p>
					<p>Now, on to the good stuff.</p>

				<div class="section-wrapper">
					<p>I've used Growl on every single copy of OSX I own. It's phenomenal. That's why I'm extremely happy Apple has finally decided to integrate a notification system into OSX. This means more apps will support notifications, and no longer will I have to check if an app is Growl compatible.</p>

					<p>The minute iMessage came out for iOS devices, I've wanted this for OSX. I think it's awesome that my request has finally been answered. Sure, a communications network among mobile devices is fine, but I'm not constantly using a mobile device. My desktop isn't an iPad. I want to be able to respond to people who have contacted me via iMessage, and I want to be able to read earlier conversations I've had with a person. Messages for OSX solves this problem.</p>

					<p>Better yet, Apple has already released a beta for OSX. I don't even have to wait for the developer release of Mountain Lion to download to be able to use Messages.</p>
					<p>You can download Messages Beta <a href="http://appldnld.apple.com/MessagesBeta/041-4274.20120216.z5km/MessagesBeta.dmg">here</a>.</p>

				<div class="section-wrapper">
					<p>For me, Twitter integration in Mountain Lion isn't that big of a deal, even though I use Twitter constantly. I'm perfectly fine with using the default Twitter client and/or Tweetbot, and I don't require that Safari, which I don't even plan on using, has a specialized Tweet button. However, the fact that Mentions and DMs show up in Notification Center makes me smile.</p>

				<div class="section-wrapper">
					<p>Apple lists iCloud as a new feature in Mountain Lion. iCloud? iCloud was released in the 10.7.2 Lion update, and is nothing new for OSX. Apple might've added more features to it or something, but chances are that is the same old iCloud integration that we all know and use.</p>
					<p>AirPlay mirroring seems like a really nice addition to OSX, so no longer will I have to call my jailbroken iPad via Skype and share the screen to mirror to my Apple TV.</p>
					<p>Overall, I think that Mac OS X Mountain Lion will be a major update for Mac users. It looks to be more refined, lacks in bugs, and include new and innovative features that we'll all take for granted in the future.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, I'll be waiting for my developer download of Mountain Lion to finish.</p>
