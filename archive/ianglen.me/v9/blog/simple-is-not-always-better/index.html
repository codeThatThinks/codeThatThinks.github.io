					<p>It may seem that I always talk about simplicity. I mean, I'm a minimalist. That's my best design philosophy. I love simplicity. It works in a variety of places, has good results, and isn't that hard to accomplish.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, simplicity doesn't work everywhere.</p>
					<p>(If you just recognized this as the beginning of a rant, and then guessed it would be about printers, someone should go award you a million internet points.)</p>
					<p>Printer design is an area where simplicity should be used sparingly. The family printer, courtesy of Kodak, is one such instance. I hate this printer. I truly do. Every single printer-related rant I have tweeted about was because of this printer.</p>
					<p>Ink has really been a problem with this printer. We were originally lured into buying it because of the 'cheap ink prices' that Kodak boasted. In hindsight, it seems like a really stupid move on our part. The thing runs out of ink constantly, and supposedly 'empty' cartridges show no indication on being low. On top of that, Kodak raised their ink prices shortly after we bought the printer, so a new set of cartridges costs over $40. It's quite apparent now that we're being ripped off.</p>
					<p>I recently stumbled on an article describing how the printer measures ink levels. It's saddening.</p>
					<p>Kodak took the simple route, and in their eyes, the safe route, when trying to figure out how to go about doing this.</p>
<pre><code>Count each time the cartridge crosses the paper, and at x times, say the cartridge is out and force the user to change it.</code></pre>
					<p>This is why I say that simplicity is not always better. This simple method of measuring ink screws the user, wastes ink, and increases frustration.</p>
					<p>Is this a design error? Probably; there are many other poorly designed features on this printer.</p>
					<p>Is this Kodak's plan for making money off this printer? Maybe. The cost of a few cartridge changes easily goes beyond the $100 cost of the printer, and with a couple years of use, it adds up quickly.</p>
